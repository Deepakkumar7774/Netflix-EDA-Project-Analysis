**📊 Netflix Content Analysis – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Project**


Welcome to the Netflix EDA project! This repository provides a deep dive into the global content library of Netflix, uncovering trends in content type, genre, geography, ratings, durations, and more using powerful data analysis and visualization tools. 🚀



**📌 Overview**


Netflix, being one of the leading streaming platforms globally, offers a vast library of content ranging across countries, genres, and formats. This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a curated Netflix dataset to extract meaningful insights about:


📅 How Netflix's content has evolved over the years

🌍 The platform’s international reach and content distribution

🎞️ Balance between Movies and TV Shows

🧠 Viewer-oriented content strategies based on genre, duration, and ratings



**🧰 Tools & Technologies Used**


🐍 Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

📊 Power BI (for additional dashboards and interactive visuals)

💬 Natural Language Processing (NLP): TextBlob

🌐 Web Scraping: BeautifulSoup

🐦 Tweepy (for Twitter sentiment analysis)

📁 Jupyter Notebook



**🎯 Project Objectives**


Perform comprehensive data cleaning and preprocessing

Explore univariate and bivariate patterns


**Analyze content distribution across:**

📽️ Content Type (Movies vs. TV Shows)

🧾 Genre (listed_in column)

🌎 Country of origin

🕒 Release year and Date added

🧒 Age ratings and durations

Create visual summaries: bar plots, pie charts, heatmaps, word clouds

Analyze gaps in genre or geography that Netflix could target



**📈 Key Insights**


🎥 Movies dominate the platform, though TV Shows drive binge-worthy engagement

🌍 Content is increasingly diversified with a surge from India, UK, South Korea, and others

⏱️ Most content has shorter durations, likely to support mobile-friendly and casual viewing

🎭 Genres like Drama, Comedy, and Documentaries are top-performing

📆 Content additions spiked significantly after 2016, aligning with global expansion

🔞 Family-friendly content with moderate ratings is widely produced

**📸 Visualizations**

**📊 This project includes multiple types of visualizations:**

Bar plots for genre frequency and ratings

Pie charts for content type distributions

Heatmaps to analyze correlations

Word clouds for genre and description analysis
